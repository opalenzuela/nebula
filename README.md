Nebula: your personal cloud
===========================

Tired of depending on limited cloud service providers? 
You don't want to pay a monthly fee for just a few GB of cloud storage? 
Do you want to keep the property of your own files? 
You don't trust your provider's security methods? 
Then get your own clowd!

This project is under `Beta` development phase and is not suitable for production use.
